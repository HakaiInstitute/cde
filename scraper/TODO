bb1_bop_level1 dataset fails because it has no max/min for lat/long?
make sure it can handle that scenario

if we use actual_range when it exists we can get out of ONC error?

if that worked, load all the data into the DB and then start setting up the endpoints, maybe try to serverless deploy the Hakai API?
